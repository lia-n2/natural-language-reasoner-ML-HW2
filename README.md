# natural-language-reasoner-ML-HW2

In this assignment, you will be given a set of sentence pairs. For each pair of sentence, the first one is considered as a precondition, while the second one is a statement. The goal is to develop a natural language reasoner to decide whether the precondition will enable or disable the statement.

For example: given the statement "A glass can be used to drink water", then the precondition "water is clean" enables this statement, while the precondition "the glass is completely broken" disables this statement.

You are free to experiment with any methods of representation, encoding , including any pre-trained models. However, using any closed-sourced LLM services like ChatGPT is not allowed.
